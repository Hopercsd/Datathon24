# Preprocessing
Run the preprocessing notebook, which takes the `train.csv` file and processes it. This script creates multiple files, each representing different preprocessing stages. The final output is a version containing the most representative and treated features. It also handles the preprocessing for the test.csv since it has to follow the same rules. 

# Modelling

These are the algorithms we tried with grid search:
Linear regression
Random forest
Extra trees
XGB boost

In the final notebook we have one example of  this with out best final model
